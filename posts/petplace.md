### Goals
Rebrand and redesign of a popular pet information website, their email templates and display ads. 

### Achievements
Created a brand that the company and users were enthusiastic about. Used latest tech in UX development to create a state-of-the-art site using Gatsby as the front end framework to create high-performing headless CMS integrated with existing legacy Wordpress database â€“ saving the company a ton of money in migrating to a new CMS. Drastically improved website pagespeed score. Integration and optimization of a new pet insurance product.

Tasked with improving the SEO for PetPlace.com and responsible for increasing the site visits to over 1MM per month. This involved extensive keyword research, content creation and optimization and backlink outreach.
