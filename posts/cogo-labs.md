### Goals
Create an email remarketing program that targets intentful consumers to contact them at the right time in the buying cycle to improve conversion rates and increase the lifetime value of a customer.

### Achievements
Through significant cadence and design testing, we were able to grow the revenue generated through email remarketing campaigns by 20x. We successfully created campaigns that resonated with our target audience to increase engagement and maintain positive metrics to ensure optimal deliverability and IP health.
